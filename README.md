# CodeAlpha_Emotion_Recognition_from_Speech
Emotion Recognition from Speech is a deep learning project that predicts human emotions such as happy, sad, angry, or neutral from speech audio. It extracts MFCC features, applies models like CNN, RNN, or LSTM, and uses datasets like RAVDESS or TESS. The system enables intelligent speech-based emotion detection for real-world applications.
